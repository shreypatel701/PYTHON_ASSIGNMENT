Que1: Understanding data types: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets.

ans: integers: int(23) it reperesent whole number.
     
     floats: it reperesent hte factional value eg 23.45

     String: It is a collection of character.

     list: It is an ordered collection of items

     tuples:It is a collection of similar and dis-similar data elements.it is ordered, immutable.

     dictionaries:A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.

     sets:set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

Que2: Python variables and memory allocation. 
ans : A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values.
      
      memory allocation in Python:
       In Python memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic as the Python developers 
       created a garbage collector for Python so that the user does not have to do manual garbage collection.

Que3: Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise.
ans: arithmetic operators:

Operator                    Name
+                           Addition
-                           Subtraction
*                           Multiplication
/                           Division
%                           Modules
//                          Floor division
**                          Exponent

Comparison operator:

Operator        Name
==              Equal
!=              Not equal
>               Greater than
<               Less than
>=              Greater than or equal to
<=              Less than or equal to

Logical operator:

Operator        Name
And             And operator
Or              Or operator
Not             Not operator

Bitwise operator:

Operator        Name            Description
&               AND             Return 1 if both operand bits are 1
|               OR              Return 1 if at least one operand bit is 1
^               XOR             Returns 1 if one of the operand bits is 1 but not both
~               NOT             Reverse all bits
<<              Left shift      Operand shift left
>>              Right shift     Operand shift right
