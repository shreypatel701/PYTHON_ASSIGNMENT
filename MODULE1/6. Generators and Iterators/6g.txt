que: Understanding how generators work in Python.
ans: Generators are a special type of iterator in Python that allow for lazy evaluation, 
    meaning they generate values one at a time as needed rather than storing them all in memory.

    A generator is a function that uses the yield keyword instead of return to produce a sequence of values lazily.

Que: Difference Between return and yield
Feature     	return	                    yield
Returns 	    Single value	            Multiple values (one at a time)
Memory Usage	Stores all data in memory	Uses lazy evaluation (efficient)
Execution	    Stops function completely	Pauses execution (can resume)
Usage	        Normal functions	        Generators


Que:Understanding iterators and creating custom iterators.

An iterator in Python is an object that allows sequential access to elements in a collection without 
exposing the underlying data structure.
Iterators follow the Iterator Protocol, meaning they must implement:

To create a custom iterator, define a class with __iter__() and __next__().
