Que: Introduction to for and while loops.

Ans:Loop is mainly use for repetition of specific code or statement.

For loop:

For loop is a sequence control loop it means we can decide how many time loop will execute.
In for loop we use range() function. 
By default for loop starts from 0 and end last-1.
Range(start,end,step)
Ex:for i in range(1,6):
print(“hello”)
it will print hello five times

While loop:
While loop is a entry control loop, it means we don’t know how many times it will run but it
terminates when specific given condition is true.

While condition:
Block of code

Que: How loops work in Python.
Ans: loop is mainly use for repetition of specific code of specific statement until given condition is
satisfied. nested loop allows to use loop inside a loop.
while loop:
in this, code will execute until give condition is satisfied. when the condition becomes false the
code after loop will execute.

initialization
while condition:
block of code

for loop:
for loop is a sequence control loop it means we can decide how many time loop will execute.
In for loop we use range() function. By using of range function we can control loop where to start
and where to end and also in how many steps.
By default for loop starts from 0 and end last-1.
Range(start,end,step)
Ex.
for i in range(1,6):
print(“hello”)
it will print hello five times

Que Using loops with collections (lists, tuples, etc.).
ans: List is a collection of similar and dis-similar data elements. It is mutable means we can change its
value.
Ex: l1 = [“shrey’” , 45 , “patel”]
for i in l1:
print(i)

use of loop in tuple:
tuple is a collection of similar and dis-similar data elements. It is immutable means we cant
change its vlaue
Ex.
t1 = (“shrey” , 45 , “patel”)
for i in t1:
print(i)
