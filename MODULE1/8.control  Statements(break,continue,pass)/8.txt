Que:Understanding the role of break, continue, and pass in Python loops.

ans: break statement::> Terminates the loop immediately and exits.
    ex: for num in range(1,6):
    if num == 5:
        break  # Loop stops when num is 5
    print(num)

    continue Statement::> Skips the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration.
    ex: for num in range(1,6):
    if num == 3:
        continue  # Skips when num is 3
    print(num)

    pass Statement::> Does nothing (acts as a placeholder).
    ex: for num in range(1, 6):
    if num == 3:
        pass 
    print(num)
